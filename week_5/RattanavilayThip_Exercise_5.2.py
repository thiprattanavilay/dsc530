#  ## Chapter 5

#  ### Exercise 5.1
#  In the BRFSS (see Section 5.4), the distribution of heights is roughly normal with parameters µ = 178 cm and σ = 7.7 cm for men, and µ = 163 cm and σ = 7.3 cm for women.
# 
#  In order to join Blue Man Group, you have to be male between 5’10” and 6’1” (see http://bluemancasting.com). What percentage of the U.S. male population is in this range? Hint: use `scipy.stats.norm.cdf`.

# In[2]:


"""
men: mean = 178, std_dev = 7.7
woman: mean = 163, amd std_Dev = 7.3
"""
men_mean = 178
men_std_dev = 7.7

# determine the normal dist from scipy.stats
men_dist = scipy.stats.norm(loc=men_mean, scale=men_std_dev)


# In[3]:


# calculate the % of men in the 5'10 to 6'1" range
low_height = 177.8 # cm 
high_height = 185.42 # cm

low_range = men_dist.cdf(low_height)
high_range = men_dist.cdf(high_height)

print("{:.2f} percent of men fall intro the 5'10 - 6'1 range".format((high_range - low_range)*100))


#  ### Exercise 5.2
#  To get a feel for the Pareto distribution, let’s see how different the world would be if the distribution of human height were Pareto. With the parameters xm = 1 m and α = 1.7, we get a distribution with a reasonable minimum, 1 m, and median, 1.5 m.
# 
#  Plot this distribution. What is the mean human height in Pareto world? What fraction of the population is shorter than the mean? If there are 7 billion people in Pareto world, how many do we expect to be taller than 1 km? How tall do we expect the tallest person to be?
# 
#  `scipy.stats.pareto` represents a pareto distribution.  In Pareto world, the distribution of human heights has parameters alpha=1.7 and xmin=1 meter.  So the shortest person is 100 cm and the median is 150.

# In[4]:


# determine the pateto dist from scipy.stats with the given parameters
xm = 1
alpha = 1.7
height_dist = scipy.stats.pareto(b=alpha, scale=xm) 


# In[5]:


# find the mean height from the pareto dist
print("The mean height is: {:.2f} m".format(height_dist.mean()))


# In[6]:


# Fraction of the population shorter than the mean.

# get the cdf of the mean
shorter_frac = height_dist.cdf(height_dist.mean())
print("The fraction of people shorter than the mean is: {:.2f}".format(shorter_frac))


# In[7]:


# How many people do you expect to be taller than 1km?
"""
x = 1000 (1km)
amt_ppl = 7e9 (7 billion)
use the sf (survival function or 1-cdf) to predict amout of ppl expect to be taller than
1km
"""
x = 1000
amt_ppl = 7e9
expected = height_dist.sf(x) * amt_ppl

print("You would expect {:.0f} people to be over 1km.".format(expected))


# In[8]:


# How tall do we expect the tallest person to be?

# search for an x value that results in the sf dunction to be close to 1.
# some trial and error
result = round(height_dist.sf(617000) * amt_ppl, 1)

print("We would expect the tallest person to be: ~617 km.")


#  ## Chapter 6

#  ### Exercise 6.1
#  The distribution of income is famously skewed to the right. In this exercise, we'll measure how strong that skew is.
#  Compute the median, mean, skewness and Pearson’s skewness of the resulting sample.
#  What fraction of households reports a taxable income below the mean?
#  How do the results depend on the assumed upper bound?

# fraction of households below the mean
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample)
print('The fraction of households below the mean: {:.2f}'.format(cdf[mean]))


# How do the results change with the upper bound? 
# 
# The upper bound effects the skewness. As the upper bound increases the moment-based skewness would also increase. The mean is only somewhat affected by an increase in the upper bound. Since the standard deviation is in the denominator it will have a strong effect on the results.
