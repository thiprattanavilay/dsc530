# Date: 12/6/20
# Course: DSC 530 – EDA
# Description: This week’s exercise is to start getting prepared for the
# exploratory data analysis we will be doing in this course by working in Python.
# -------------------------------------------------

# Display the text “Hello World! I wonder why that is always the default
# coding text to start with”
print('Hello World! I wonder why that is always the default coding text to start with.')

# Add two numbers together
add = 300 + 65
print(add)

# Subtract a number from another number
subtract = 2020 - 1983
print(subtract)

# Multiply two numbers
multiply = 50 * 60
print(multiply)

# Divide between two numbers
divide = 300 / 65
print(divide)

# Concatenate two strings together (any words)
word1 = 'Happy'
word2 = 'NewYear'
happy_new_year = word1 + word2
print(happy_new_year)

# Create a list of 4 items (can be strings, numbers, both)
party_items = ["Champagne", "Chips & Dips", "Balloons", "Confetti"]
print(party_items)

# Append an item to your list (again, can be a string, number)
party_items.append("12:00 AM")
print(party_items)

# Create a tuple with 4 items (can be strings, numbers, both)
party_time = ("Dance", 'Music', 'People', 2021)
print(party_time)
